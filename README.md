# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to generate information that future proofs the number of employees that will retire as well as the departments that will become available for the next genereation of Pewlett employees as a result. 
After predicting these results, another analysis was done to identify the employees who are eligible to partcipate in a mentorship program created by the company.

## Results 
#### Deliverable 1
###### The task for this deliverable was to create a query that showed the number of employees that were retiring by their job title.
- Looking at the output of the data, thousands of employees will be retiring around the same time. 
- To help future proof the number of retiring employees, a query was retrieved to count the retiring employees most recent job positions. Looking at the output table below, some of the most popular positions are; Engineering positions and software staff.
###### Retired Titles

#### Deliverable 2
###### The purpose of deliverable 2 is to make a table that held the current retiring employees who could participate in the mentorship program.
- The result of this table showed 1,549 of Pewlett Hackard employees will be eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
- Many of these eligible employees held senior engineering and senior staff positions. 

## Summary
- There will be roughly 40,000 positions that will need to be filled when the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. The results showed that there will only be 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This could leave the company unprepared for the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
###### Mentorship eligibility

- That number is incredibly less than the currently employed postions. Due to the number of positions opening, there will not be enough mentors for the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. We can infer that the titles that will have mentors are engineering and staff but there are other positions that will need more mentors when the "silver tsunami" has an impact.
