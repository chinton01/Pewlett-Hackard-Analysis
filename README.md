# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to generate information that predicts the number of employees that will retire as well as the departments that will become available as a result. 
After predicting these results, another analysis was done to identify the employees who are eligible to partcipate in a mentorship program created by the company.

## Results Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- When conducting the first deliverable, thoousands of employees will be retiring.
- The first deliverable provides an insight on which job titles had the most employees which will help the company to predict how many newcomers will be needed.
- The second deliverable provides a list of employees that will retire than could be qualified to participate in the mentorship program.
- Engineering positions and software staff were the most frequent positions of soon to be retiring employees.

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- There will be roughly 40,000 positions that will need to be filled when the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

- There will be enough retirement-ready employees for mentoring in the engineering departments. However, management positions seems to be an area that will need more employees for the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
