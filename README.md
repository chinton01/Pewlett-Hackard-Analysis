# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to generate information that predicts the number of employees that will retire as well as the departments that will become available as a result. 
After predicting these results, another analysis was made to identify the employees who are eligible to partcipate in a mentorship program created by the company.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.



Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
